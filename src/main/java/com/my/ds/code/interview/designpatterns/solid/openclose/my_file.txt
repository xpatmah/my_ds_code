The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is a core tenet of object-oriented design in Java, stating that software entities
(classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
This means you should be able to add new functionality or change behavior by adding new code (extensions) without
altering the existing, tested source code. Adhering to the OCP promotes system stability, maintainability,
and scalability while minimizing the risk of introducing new bugs into existing functionality.
