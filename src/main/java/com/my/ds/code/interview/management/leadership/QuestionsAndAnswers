Q What is your leadership style? How do you adapt it?
Ans My core style leans towards coaching and democratic leadership, fostering collaboration and growth, but I'm highly adaptive. For
instance, with a new, inexperienced team, I'd adopt a more directive approach with clear instructions. For a seasoned team tackling
 creative challenge, I'd empower them with a laissez-faire or democratic style. I adapt by constantly checking in, assessing
 individual needs, and ensuring my style matches the task's complexity and the team's maturity, always focusing on achieving results."

Q How do you build trust and a positive culture within a team?

To successfully answer interview questions about building trust and culture, use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) t
 provide concrete examples that highlight transparency, empathy, collaboration, and accountability.
 Focus on demonstrating:
Reliability: Following through on commitments and setting clear expectations.
Safety: Fostering environments where people feel safe to speak up and admit mistakes.
Respect: Valuing diverse perspectives and treating all colleagues equitably.


Q What do you consider the most important qualities of a great leader?

skills. Integrity builds the crucial foundation of trust and ethical behavior, while vision allows the leader to set a clear
direction and inspire their team towards shared goals. Effective communication ensures everyone understands the objectives and feels
heard and valued.
